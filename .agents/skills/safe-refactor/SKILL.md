# Safe refactor

Define behavior-preservation boundary and establish verification before structural edits.

- Keep feature changes outside refactor.
- Move one ownership boundary at a time.
- Preserve public interfaces, failure behavior, ordering, and compatibility unless explicitly scoped.
- Keep intermediate states buildable and testable.
- Avoid dependency or configuration growth without correctness need.

Run same proof after change. When repository offers tagged automated cases, run every affected component tag together and skip unrelated tags. Use full suite when refactor crosses component boundaries broadly. Stop when behavior matches and requested structure is achieved.
